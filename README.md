## NP-React
The aim of this project is to implement desktop version of NovaPoshta application.

## Local development quickstart
Install dependencies and run app in dev mode:
```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```
Open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and set `npuid` and `tokenoauth2` values in localStorage via DevTools. <br/>
Refresh the page (`F5`).

## Clarifications
1. Full login flow will be implemented later.
2. For now, this project works only in dev mode as it relies on integrated proxy to send and receive data from NovaPoshta API endpoints.
